# process-viewer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GuillaumeGomez/process-viewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GuillaumeGomez/process-viewer)
A process viewer GUI in rust. It provides current status of your processes (cpu and memory usage) and your system (usage of every core and of your RAM, and the temperature of your composants if this information is available).

# WARNING!

For now, it only builds on rust __nightly__!
